## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The code was developed in python 3 along with the libraries that it already has installed, being applicable in Anaconda. The libraries used were:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* os
* time
* Scikit learn

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

I was interested in analyzing customer information from a mail-order sales company, in such a way that I could find individuals from a population group in Germany who could become potential customers by applying unsupervised machine learning. On the other hand, using Supervised Machine Learning models, we chose the best model that was capable of predicting for a group of individuals, given their variables, the probability that they were or were not customers of the company.

## Instructions <a name="instructions"></a>

Since the data is privately owned, it is not possible to run the Notebook, it will simply serve as a publication to understand the analysis and modeling process. If the person has access to the data, previously signed the consent or permission with the company, they can download and run the Notebook, otherwise refrain from running the notebook.

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>
The data files are not publicly available, as the data sets are proprietary. Must give credit to [Arvato Financial Solutions](https://finance.arvato.com/) for the data. Given my learning process with Udacity (Data Science Nanodegree) and for which I am grateful, feel free to give me recommendations that allow me to continue growing as a data scientist, any concern or appreciation will be well received!
