    "# Capstone Project: Create a Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Services\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population. You'll use unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation, identifying the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, you'll apply what you've learned on a third dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company, and use a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.\n",
    "\n",
    "The versions of those two datasets used in this project will include many more features and has not been pre-cleaned. You are also free to choose whatever approach you'd like to analyzing the data rather than follow pre-determined steps. In your work on this project, make sure that you carefully document your steps and decisions, since your main deliverable for this project will be a blog post reporting your findings."

    "## Part 0: Get to Know the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four data files associated with this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Udacity_AZDIAS_052018.csv`: Demographics data for the general population of Germany; 891 211 persons (rows) x 366 features (columns).\n",
    "- `Udacity_CUSTOMERS_052018.csv`: Demographics data for customers of a mail-order company; 191 652 persons (rows) x 369 features (columns).\n",
    "- `Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TRAIN.csv`: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42 982 persons (rows) x 367 (columns).\n",
    "- `Udacity_MAILOUT_052018_TEST.csv`: Demographics data for individuals who were targets of a marketing campaign; 42 833 persons (rows) x 366 (columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row of the demographics files represents a single person, but also includes information outside of individuals, including information about their household, building, and neighborhood. Use the information from the first two files to figure out how customers (\"CUSTOMERS\") are similar to or differ from the general population at large (\"AZDIAS\"), then use your analysis to make predictions on the other two files (\"MAILOUT\"), predicting which recipients are most likely to become a customer for the mail-order company.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"CUSTOMERS\" file contains three extra columns ('CUSTOMER_GROUP', 'ONLINE_PURCHASE', and 'PRODUCT_GROUP'), which provide broad information about the customers depicted in the file. The original \"MAILOUT\" file included one additional column, \"RESPONSE\", which indicated whether or not each recipient became a customer of the company. For the \"TRAIN\" subset, this column has been retained, but in the \"TEST\" subset it has been removed; it is against that withheld column that your final predictions will be assessed in the Kaggle competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, all of the remaining columns are the same between the three data files. For more information about the columns depicted in the files, you can refer to two Excel spreadsheets provided in the workspace. [One of them](./DIAS Information Levels - Attributes 2017.xlsx) is a top-level list of attributes and descriptions, organized by informational category. [The other](./DIAS Attributes - Values 2017.xlsx) is a detailed mapping of data values for each feature in alphabetical order.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the below cell, we've provided some initial code to load in the first two datasets. Note for all of the `.csv` data files in this project that they're semicolon (`;`) delimited, so an additional argument in the [`read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) call has been included to read in the data properly. Also, considering the size of the datasets, it may take some time for them to load completely.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll notice when the data is loaded in that a warning message will immediately pop up. Before you really start digging into the modeling and analysis, you're going to need to perform some cleaning. Take some time to browse the structure of the data and look over the informational spreadsheets to understand the data values. Make some decisions on which features to keep, which features to drop, and if any revisions need to be made on data formats. It'll be a good idea to create a function with pre-processing steps, since you'll need to clean all of the datasets before you work with them."

However, when we see the customers dataframe, the scenario changes a bit, since if we applied the same principle of eliminating columns with 20% we would be eliminating most of the columns. With the above, so that both dataframes have the same rule, I consider removing the columns that are in customers dataframe with more than 30% null. Why customers dataframe¡ because it has more attrributes than azdias dataframe."

    "     - Step 8: Drop correlated Features\n",

    "   There you will see a lot of commented code and this is because in these steps there is column removal. These columns do not\n",
    "   they would come out the same as if you ran the code because the columns to remove at each step were obtained by parsing\n",
    "   the two dataframes, that is, CUSTOMERS and AZDIAS. While executing the lines of code as the function idea\n",
    "   is that it cleans CUSTOMERS and AZDIAS separately, obtaining the columns to eliminate will not matter in each case.\n",
    "   Due to the above, it is that given that previous analysis, it is that I list the columns to be eliminated so \n",
    "   that it is the same in both dataframes.\n",
    "2. Applying the clean_data function is validated that it gives the same result as what I got in the previous analysis.\n",
    "   Proof of this are the cells before this cell, giving the same number of columns and rows in both dataframes.\n",
    "3. As an improvement, I think that in the analysis I could have included a phase of analysis of OUTLIERS, for now I did not manipulate them"

    "Since we already have our clean, pre-processed and scaled data, we must now carry out the Modeling phase. But before that, since we must choose the best model that is capable of predicting whether an individual will become a customer or not, it is necessary to evaluate it and based on this, the one with the best evaluation would be selected. And how do we evaluate it? Machine learning models have evaluation metrics, in the specific case of classification models we find metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall. However, if we were predicting, for example, a patient whether or not he has cancer, precision would be selected because where it is serious where a client who had cancer but the model says no, the impact is serious by not treating someone who did need it. that is, the True Positives (TP). So Precision TP/(TP+FP) would be helping me determine how accurate our results are in predicting whether or not a client will have cancer. For this case, I have decided to use the AUC-ROC curves since they consider the true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR). As such, there is no minimum to determine from more than one model, which is the best, but simply the one with the highest score, although there are those who recommend a minimum of 0.8, but in my case, I will be interested in the one with the best score.\n",

    "When navigating through the data, both from the company's customers and from the general population of Germany, it was clear that we were going to encounter a large number of variables, which could impact the performance of our Machine Learning models, and being important to go to the dictionary that explained the definition, and the possible data in them, for a proper understanding of the business and the data. I think it was right to have generated a data cleaning function, since that allowed it to be used in the other datasets. As an appreciation that I commented at the time, I did not want to treat the outliers since I did not consider that they were rare data that were the reason for elimination, but that they are people who in real life have these behaviors, and their elimination could erase knowledge. I am happy to remove columns and records based on the number of NaNs and those not in the dictionary, since we would not know what exactly we have of those unknown columns.\n",

    "When moving to the unsupervised model, with clean, pre-processed, and scaled data, we began to see the importance of performing PCA since there were many variables, and thus allowed us to general segmentation, with the number of clusters. I found it interesting to be able to discover potential clients for the business, by associating each cluster, and this is how we observe which clusters and therefore which clients would be clients, and who would not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, with the prediction model, with the training data, we applied the data cleaning function, the scaling function, as I stated at the time, it was the test decision to balance the data so that there was no bias in the model. Additionally, I wanted to test mostly computationally robust models, so that it would allow me to generate the best model for our problem. Once the best model has been learned, and with the hyperparameterization, we already generated the prediction, where it indicates that there are 6,731 potential individuals to be clients of the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Within the structure of the Notebook, the directory or location to make the prediction to the TEST set was not suggested, so understanding that in part 0 they said about this activity especially to be compared to kaggle, it is that I carried out that prediction stage."
